\tagline{\textcolor{yellow}{6+} years experience of large-scale software development
         with \textcolor{yellow}{C} programming on the \textcolor{yellow}{Linux} system
         throughout my Ph.D. journey.
         Seeking a challenging and rewarding opportunity with
         low-level system programming
         (eg. \textcolor{yellow}{device driver, Linux kernel, CPU architecture})
         to apply my skills at a fabless company.}
