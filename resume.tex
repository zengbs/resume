% Achieving a good looking spacing can be tricky.
% For empty pagestyles where the full width is available use

% to take up all the available space.
% The (relative) lengths reserved for date, journal and links can be set with the parameters
% \texttt{\textbackslash pubdatelength}, \texttt{\textbackslash pubjournallength} and
% \texttt{\textbackslash publinklength} as in
% \texttt{\textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash pubdatelength\}\{0.15 \textbackslash linewidth\}}.
