\tagline{Amazing tag line that makes HR managers want to hire you immediately.\\The tag line is aligned with the bottom of the picture to the right, so if you have\\multiple lines it fills the space to your name from the bottom. You might want to\\introduce manual line breaks to make this look nicer then simply filling up the lines.}

%    The default page style is \texttt{headerhighlightmain} with all three elements.

%    use page style \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}}.
%    Neither main, nor highlight bar must be filled to make this template work.
%    It is possible to use a page style with the highlight bar
%    but leave it empty by setting an empty highlightbar \texttt{\textbackslash highlightbar\{\}}.

% Demonstrate what an \texttt{\textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\}} page looks like.
% Also show off the macros for publications that uses small icons for authors,

% Achieving a good looking spacing can be tricky.
% For empty pagestyles where the full width is available use
% \texttt{\textbackslash pubforcefullwidth} to force the publoication list
% to take up all the available space.
% The (relative) lengths reserved for date, journal and links can be set with the parameters
% \texttt{\textbackslash pubdatelength}, \texttt{\textbackslash pubjournallength} and
% \texttt{\textbackslash publinklength} as in
% \texttt{\textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash pubdatelength\}\{0.15 \textbackslash linewidth\}}.
